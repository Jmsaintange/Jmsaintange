    <h1>Adventurer, Dreamer, and Travel Enthusiast</h1>
    <p>I’m <strong>James Mike Saint Ange</strong>, a hard-working and driven individual who isn’t afraid to face a challenge. I’m passionate about my work and I know how to get the job done. I would describe myself as an open and honest person who doesn’t believe in misleading other people and tries to be fair in everything I do. Therefore, my dream came true at JTC, where I aligned my career’s transition as a Web Developer with a passion for coding and creating beautiful websites.</p>
